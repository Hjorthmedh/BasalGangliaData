# Adding new models - generated by BluePyOpt

When new models are created by BluePyOpt, we should incorporate these into Snudda simulations

The file format requirements of Snudda, means we have to "re-package" the models. Additionally, we calculate hash sums of models - to control their contents.

Within [transfer_models_from_bluepyopt](transfer_models_from_bluepyopt.ipynb),
    we describe the steps to convert the models into a "Snudda" format.
