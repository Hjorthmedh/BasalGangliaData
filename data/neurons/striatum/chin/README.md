ChIN models opt 0-2 transferred by RL 2025-04-02 from this repo:
https://github.com/jofrony/ChIN-LTS-Network-simulation/tree/master/config/CholinergicOptimisation

The model catalogues were manually updated:
- with a config folder (holding mechanisms.json and parameters.json)
- with a morphology folder (holding the swc-file)
- a hall_of_fame.json file (holding selected parameter sets from best_models.json

Only parameter sets with a specific param file in the base of the model folder (e.g. v0 or v9) were added
